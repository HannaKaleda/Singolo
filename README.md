# singolo

**See project demo** - https://hannakaleda.github.io/singolo/

The Singolo landing page was created using **HTML, CSS, JS**

**Sections description**

**Header**
1. Menu with switching. The selected menu item remains active, the previous one becomes inactive. The page moves anchors to a given position with smooth animation. Upon transition and scrolling. The menu item of the block where the current position is located becomes active.

**Slider**
1. The carousel changes the image to a new one when you press the switch buttons. The carousel is infinite, i.e. you can press "right" all the time and the pictures will constantly change.
2. On the Slide-1 there are 2 phones: vertical and horizontal. The screen goes blank when you press the phone. This means that a black background exactly the size of the screen should appear instead of the picture. The screen picture appears again when you click on the "turned off" phone.

**Portfolio**
1. The new tab becomes active when tabs at the top of the block are switched. Pictures below change their position shifting by the same amount.
2. A frame appears around a picture when you click on it. The previous picture loses the frame and the new one gets it when you click on another picture.

**Get a quote**
1. The user must enter the required data when filling out the form. Submitting the form will not perform the default submit action. Instead, a modal window appears on the top of the layout with information from the form.
